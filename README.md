===========

Welcome to the MinerApocalypse RFC/issue tracker!

# Summary
Here you can create an account to discuss or propose changes plugins, gameplay, rules, etc. for the MinerApocalypse minecraft server.

# Contributing
Reading current proposals can be done without authentication, but to submit an issue, signup for an account.

# Issues/Proposals
## Drafts
Anyone can create an issue, but until it is fully fleshed out and edited, it will remain in the Draft RFC section.
During this stage, issues are not fully written and may be heavily revised at any time.
They are also not confirmed as being a valid proposal by the Direction Board, which means they have not been confirmed as not spam/repost/etc.
During this stage, most modifications will be performed by the user as they flesh out their idea.
Discussion is encouraged at this point, but mainly to propose alternatives to the issue before the formal proposal is made.

## Proposals
Once an issue has been fully drafted, it will be reviewed by the direction board and submitted as an official Proposed RFC.
This means that the issue has been reviewed and accepted as a valid issue by the Direction Board.
This does not mean the issue has been accepted or that it has passed an approval vote by the Direction Board, but merely that the proposal follows contribution guidelines and actually proposes a gameplay/rule/plugin change.
At this stage, discussion is at its most active, and focuses on the central idea itself, without diverting into a broader scope (e.g. discussing the PVP fix proposal in the issue, rather than PVP in general).

## Direction Board Review
At this stage, discussion has mainly completed and the issue has been submitted to the Direction Board for veto. Additionally, no more changes should be made to the issue unless the proposal fails to pass by the Direction Board.

## Oversight Review
The proposal has been accepted for implementation by the Direction Board, and now the Oversight Board will rule to veto again, and review the proposal once more.

## Implementation
The proposal has been drafted, reviewed, submitted, approved by both Direction and Oversight, and is now in-progress of being implemented onto the server.

## Done
Proposals that have been implemented onto the server will be stored in this category, both for future reference as well as for possible future discussion on modifications/repeal of the proposal.
